# Amanpreet Ahluwalia – Applied AI Engineer (Enterprise Systems)

Live site: https://amanpreetsingh0071.github.io/Aman_portfolio

This portfolio presents applied AI projects focused on automation, anomaly detection, and decision support within enterprise and business-critical systems.

My background includes 7+ years working with ERP, finance, and operational platforms, now combined with hands-on delivery of production-ready AI and ML solutions. The projects here prioritise reliability, data quality, and real-world constraints rather than experimental demos.
